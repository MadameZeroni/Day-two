while using NLTK I explored the text Mody dick using exercises from chapter one of NLTK programming book. 
we did concordance using the words such as monstrous and ship.
then we used similar to find words similar to monstrous, ship and angry.
we continued by finding the word counted for all nine books and found which ever had the largest amount of words in a text.
